                            "It was difficult at first <br />
                            More than I will admit" <br />

                            It was burdensome <br />
                            But after accepting it, <br />
                            it makes me too sorrowful. <br />
                            <br />
                            Honestly, this is the truth<br />
                            There is no use in trying to hold on to the scattered pieces<br />
                            It will only break my heart<br />
                            But as I continue living like this,<br />
                            I wonder what the point of living is<br />
                            <br />
                            I was resentful at first<br />
                            And crying – I cried a lot<br />
                            But after continuing on in this way<br />
                            I wondered what I was doing<br />   
                            <br />
                            Honestly, this is the truth<br />
                            There is no use in trying to hold on to the scattered pieces<br />
                            It will only break my heart<br />
                            But as I continue living like this,<br />
                            I wonder what the point of living is<br />
                            <br />
                            Sometimes, I standing inside the same memory with you<br />
                            I’m frozen in time with you<br />
                            <br />
                            How is the separation?<br />
                            Was it just enough for you to endure, since you were prepared for it?<br />
                            Was it less painful?<br />
                            What about love?<br />
                            Is it worth doing again?<br />
                            Honestly, this is my truth<br />
                            I’m just afraid<br />
                            <br />
                            This is all that I can say<br />
                            I repeat it to myself, the words that let you go<br />
                            They will never be able to reach you, the words that let you go<br />
