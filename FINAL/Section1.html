                            The tree only revealed its beauty through a flurry of pink petals in the spring, but this made spring her favorite season. In autumn, the leaves changed to a golden yellow. She appreciated their glow, but they couldn’t compare to the captivating blossoms she admired. She detested winter, and lacked motivation when the sight outside of her window painted a desolate landscape of bare bark on a white canvas.
                        <br /><br />
                            She sat curled up in the corner of her bed, her head leaning against the window as she idly drew pictures on the glass. She lazily traced flowers onto empty branches in a dreamlike state until her trance shattered. A weak man stood at her door, his eyes seemed tired and pleading.
                        <br /><br />
                        “Vivianne, would you like to come down and eat?” he asked, his voice full of fatigue and some other constrained emotion.
                        <br /><br />
                        “Sure daddy…” Her hand dropped to her lap and it seemed like she made no effort to move. For a moment, she looked like a doll as she sat perfectly still with the winter’s snow reflecting against her skin.
                        <br /><br />
                        They sat at a small table set for only two. The girl sat there wrapped in a sweater and blanket despite sitting indoors. A small, green ribbon kept her hair out of her face even as she hung her head low.
                        <br /><br />
                        Her father cleared his throat and started with, “You have your appointment this weekend… Then maybe after winter break we can enroll you in high school.”
                        <br /><br />
                        High school? In Vivianne’s mind high school existed far in her future. In her present, she still felt like a child, she had not matured.

                        “I… That feels… Too soon…” Her small voice protested. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Her father’s face tightened up, but he took a short breath and continued calmly, “Why does it feel too soon?”
                        <br /><br />
                        “I can’t… I don’t feel… Okay yet. I can go in the spring. I can get better then, I promise,” her small voice gained strength as her words gained confidence. Her father sighed and looked off to the wall or possibly a memory that seemed more pleasant than his current circumstance.
                        <br /><br />
                        Vivianne started school in February, a month before spring. She fixed her ribbon, buttoned her coat, and made her way there with a stomach full of worms and bubbling acid. She unexpectedly made a friend in her first class; a bright spirit named Carrie. Her smiling warmed Vivianne’s cold heart and hands whenever she came in to class. It made Vivianne think of spring and the bubbling in her stomach settled. They decided to walk home together under a cloudy sky.
                        <br /><br />
                        “You have a magnolia tree?” Carrie asked as they stopped in front of a tiny, crooked house. Vivianne’s head perked up at the observation, “Yeah, it looks a lot prettier when it blooms…” Vivianne thought she would feel excited but she just started to feel sick instead.
                        <br /><br />
                        “I’d love to see it when it blooms!” Carrie smiled warmly with all the love in her soul and Vivianne felt slightly less sick, as if Carrie had some sort of super power within her.
                        <br /><br />
                        Vivianne managed a small smile and said goodbye as she made her way inside.
                        <br /><br />
                        Vivianne felt miserable. She thought she could make it to school today but she ended up not moving from her curled up position against the window. She couldn’t even manage to lift her head to look out the window. She kept telling herself that everything would get better in spring; she just had to wait. Truly, she didn’t want spring to come at all. As it got closer to spring, she felt weaker and weaker. Her father appeared at her door, looking less tired and more nervous; he seemed distressed.
                        <br /><br />
                        “Carrie stopped by to see you, you should say hello… And thank her for stopping by.” He left and Vivianne stayed perfectly still.

                    <div class="FPs2text">
                        Hours later, the front door opened and Carrie sat there on the front steps with a warm expression. Vivianne didn’t expect her to wait for so long in the cold weather. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Carrie just smiled and said, “A magnolia tree doesn’t usually bloom in February right?”
                        <br /><br />
                        Vivianne didn’t understand but once she saw said tree she gasped. In front of her, she saw the tree in full bloom. Pink petals gracefully fell and landed onto a fresh bed of snow. She ran up to the tree despite her bare feet in the snow. 
                        <br /><br />
                        After a few moments of silence, Vivianne turned to Carrie and said, “My… My mother… she planted this tree for me. She planted it when she turned eighteen. She wanted to plant a tree at a young age so it would grow up by the time she had her first child. It bloomed for the first time when I turned six. It made me so happy… I thought my mother was a fairy or something. But she… died… right before my birthday, so only my father and I saw the tree bloom for the first time.”
                        <br /><br />
                        Carrie listened closely to her friend and watched her intense gaze on the magnolias. She then saw a small smile appear, as well as a tear falling.
                        <br /><br />
                        “I guess she couldn’t wait until spring…” Carrie commented quietly. Vivianne paused for a moment but then let out a laugh, even as her tears began to spill.
                        <br /><br />
                        “Ahaha! Yeah, she couldn’t wait… She wanted to see me…”  Vivianne let out the warmest laugh that Carrie had ever heard. What felt like a cold winter day to the rest of the world; felt like the warmest spring day to Vivianne and Carrie.
