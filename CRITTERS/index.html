<p class="QT">"The old world of graphic design and production was, in effect, a preproduction enterprise. Design was everything before the reproduction of it: ideas made visible and intentions made transmittable."<br></p>
    <div id="QTSM">The discussion regarding the designer's solipsism as well as the mention of the Hephaestus is stunningly stark. The Greek god, originally a blacksmith, is no doubt a primal conception of a "designer" when fit to the standards of modern society. There was this overwhelming need and want for the polishing of crafts and "skills" throughout history that was mostly exclusive for the artist population. Now that urge has traveled into the arms of the modern designer, only to be shortly violated by the emergence of streamlined standards. However, the arts of crafts are, contrary to the common belief, still persevering - we are living in a physical world that requires designers to keep due of the calibration between reality and the computer screen. For instance, the SEGD field (otherwise known as spatial graphics: including exhibition design, wayfinding, placemaking, and interactive media, etc) still requires a constant update on contemporary technology on craftsmanship and its methodologies to truly engage its audience to the 3D space. The physicality of the works brings forth centuries old questions on how a material is used in what context to effectively bring forth an impact in the viewers. Even now, the SEGD organization runs a forum that connects all members (mostly designers) with various discussions on how, what, where, and why--capturing the effort to overcome the modern limitations of the designer by actively inquiring, nowadays vendor-specific, techniques within production. Technology has definitely changed the scape of what craft and craftsmanship means, but as mentioned, "the craftsman is special because he or she is an engaged human being [...] still the craftsmanâ€™s aspirations and trials hold up a mirror to these larger issues past and present."
